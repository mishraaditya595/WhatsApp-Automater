# Oblivia
Oblivia is an automated Whatsapp Message Sender. Oblivia makes it easy for you to send messages to people at a predefined time which you can set according to you. A very good example of this could be suppose that you want to wish someone one there Birthday at exactly 12 but you are sleepy, you could type in the message you want to be sent and the time at which you want the message to be sent. The application would send it to the contact chosen at the exact time.
